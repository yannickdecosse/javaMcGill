Create a Java application from 3 java source files called Program.java, Student.java and
Classroom.java.

In the source file Program.java is a single class called Program with a single static main
method. This main method will have the only user interface. The other java files are not
permitted to perform any I/O. In other words, only the main method is permitted to write
to the screen or read from the keyboard.

Program.java is the only class permitted to instantiate objects. The other two java files
are not permitted to instantiate anything.

Write a main method that asks the user for the size of a classroom and then the number of
students they would like to add into that classroom. Next, instantiate a classroom object
using the classroom size the user wanted. Then, using a loop, instantiate one Student
object for each student the user wanted and populate its class variables by prompting the
user for information. Put these student objects into the classroom. To verify that you did
this correctly, your main method will then display all the student information from the
classroom. Format this output in an easy to read way. The output must be from objects
returned to your main method by the classroom object. Your program will then end.
In the source file Student.java is a single class called Student. Each student class stores
the information for a single student. Everything in this class is private except for the API.
